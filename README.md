These are scripts I've used at work. 

## PDF Renamers

**Creation Date**

This script is a re-worked version of [pdf-rename-by-cdate.sh](https://gist.github.com/tjluoma/205e3d85e46eb6025b87c6db5b77375b) which didn't work at all for me. Mine is a lot simpler and includes the time as well as the date which helps to generate unique file names. I use this to batch rename invoices every month. Not all PDFs have a creation date in its metadata though, which has led me to make another renaming script.
